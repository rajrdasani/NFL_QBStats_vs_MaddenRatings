# 2023 QB Stats vs Madden 24 Ratings
See if stats from the 2022-23 season can predict Madden Ratings, and if general public sentiment lines up

Main goal is to see if stats from the 2022-23 season can predict Madden Ratings, and if general public sentiment lines up. A thread:

First, looking at Basic / Box Score stats, I chose only stats that a viewer could see or calculate when watching a game (Yards, Attempts, # 1st Downs, etc). These were then standardized, and then summed, to create a general ranking of QBs via these counting stats (x-axis). 

3 key details stick out: 
1. Lamar is the biggest outlier by far as a below average passer with a top 5 Madden Rating, obviously not accounting for his rushing ability. 
2. Based on pure production, Geno Smith, Jared Goff, and Kirk Cousins are underrated by about 3-5 rating points, with Andy Dalton and Daniel Jones needing to be closer to the high 70s based on their production 
3. The tier 6 QBs are due for some big changes this upcoming year, with their ceilings as high as Lamarâ€™s via Madden


Next was focusing on the Advanced Stats, such as CPOE (completion % over expected) and - OnTgt% (% of on-target throws per pass attempt), while accounting for some factors out of their control like Drop % (Percentage of passes dropped per pass attempt) 

Key Insights:
1. Overall, the difference in Madden Ratings show to be a bit over-differentiated between the top-middle tier of QBs and the middle-tiers
2. This is where most of the community has Josh Allen vs Joe Burrow, with Allen having a clear edge over Burrow stats wise, but pure box score had Burrow ahead
3. Jalen Hurts earns his flowers here as a Top 5 QB by advanced passing numbers, a lot more than the box score showed
4. With none of these being cumulative stats, we see less distinction between most of the starting QBs, which could say that some of these Tier 3 QBs could provide a lot more value in better situations
5. Tier 4 can be pretty controversial, especially when side by side with Tier 3, with many of these as elite runners, but questionable numbers going into this year, that many expect them to turn around, but not all of them will.
6. Tua is just Tua, but his WR help does show up clearly in the data! He has one of the highest Bad Throw %s, but it's canceled out by the top numbers in Adjusted Net Yards per Attempt, Intended Air Yards per Attempt, and Completed air yards per completion, indications of the elite passing game in Miami, which he is at the forefront of.
